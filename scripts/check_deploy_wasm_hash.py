"""Diff freshly-built contract WASM hashes against deploy/testnet.json (#274).

Two modes:
  check   Fail (exit 1) if the sha256 of a locally built WASM file doesn't
          match the hash recorded in the deploy manifest. Used to catch a
          stale/incorrect manifest, or a deploy that silently didn't update
          the on-chain contract to the code it claims.
  update  Recompute the sha256 of each built WASM and write it into the
          deploy manifest. Run this right after a successful deploy so the
          manifest stays in sync going forward.

Usage:
  check_deploy_wasm_hash.py check  <manifest.json> <name>=<wasm-path> [<name>=<wasm-path> ...]
  check_deploy_wasm_hash.py update <manifest.json> <name>=<wasm-path> [<name>=<wasm-path> ...]
